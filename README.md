## Notes
This project was developed individually on my laptop as part of a **university course project**. It was later uploaded to GitHub, which is why the **GitHub contribution graph does not reflect the actual development timeline**.

## Future Improvements
- Adding user authentication (login/register).
- Adding online payment integration.
- Developing a web version using React and Node.js.
